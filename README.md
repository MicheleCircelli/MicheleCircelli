# Michele Circelli, Ph.D.

Operations Research & Optimization Scientist with a double international Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science (Universities of Bologna & Barcelona). I build end-to-end decision-support tools: from mathematical modeling (MILP / network flow) to Python implementations and solver pipelines.

## Current role
- **Operations Research & Optimization Scientist @ UPintelligence S.L. (Oviedo, Spain)**  
  Logistics planning, resource allocation, and public-transport fleet optimization using graph-based formulations and scenario analysis.

## Expertise
- **Optimization & OR:** MILP, network flows, scheduling, heuristics/metaheuristics, stochastic simulation (Monte Carlo)
- **Engineering mindset:** translate operational requirements into robust models and usable tools for cross-functional teams
- **Math background:** PDE-based modeling with applications to transport and traffic flow

## Tech stack
- **Python / MATLAB**, Git
- **Optimization:** Gurobi, PuLP
- **Data/ML:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib

## Selected publications (Math)
- Lipschitz regularity for an orthotropic q-Laplacian-type equation in the Heisenberg group — *Advances in Differential Equations* (2026)
- Transport densities and congested optimal transport in the Heisenberg group — *JMAA* (2026)
